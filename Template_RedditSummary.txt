Framework 16 Batch Chart Weekly Summary: 4-14-24 to 4-20-24

All of this week’s progress was in the first half of the week, so hopefully the start of next week will bring good news. Batch 9 received their first laptops on Monday, so they get to have fun with their shiny new tech! On Tuesday, batch 10’s cards were charged with deliveries now on the way, and batch 11 got their batch prep email!

All this data is gathered from the FW16 Batch Guilds and the Batches Shipping Log topics on the [Framework Community Forum](https://community.frame.work/). 
You can also find my [Batch Shipment Chart](https://community.frame.work/t/framework-laptop-16-batch-shipment-chart/47120/) topic there where I post updates more often.
This chart was made in Google Sheets, see all the [data at this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12nY1kIrX8Isnfkr5E2J14ZdPPNDHkAsUxieSKjGgeak/edit?usp=sharing)
